        <h1 id="title">Why This is Important</h1>
        <p id="paragraph">Everyone deserves to have a sleek, fashion-forward, and camouflage way to be able to listen to music. With a wide range of skin tones, and further ones being made every day with your feedback, everyone will be able to have their own way to listen to music. Instead of having a bright white Airpod in your ear, have a sleek way to listen to music however and whenever you want to. </p>
        <p id="paragraph">In order to recieve more feedback about the tones of the U-Airpods, we have started out with simple designs. These are the basic U-Airpods, but we have also made it possible to recieve custom U-Airpods that match your skin tone perfectly. In order to do this online, you can look up any foundation that you know fits your skin color, and then enter the brand, name, and ID code provided, to be able to create your own specific range. In stores, just go to any Apple store and ask to be scanned for your own specific skin tone in order to perfectlty create your own</p>

        <h1 id="title">Our Story</h1>
        <p id="paragraph">With the modern age fashion consisting of neutral colors, the sleek look is something that most people want to achieve. So, what looks glamourous and customized, specifically for you? Your own U-Airpods. With makeup companies struggling to create a shade range for everybody, we figured that the technology industry should take on the challange as well.</p>
        <p id="paragraph">With phones and laptops, you can use cases and decals to personalize them more. But, because headphones are so small, especially bluetooth, there is no way to customize them. So, we started creating U-Airpods. Soon, buisness was growing as many people seemed to like the idea of their personal shade range! We continued to expand, and soon realized that we needed a bigger production facility.</p>
        <p id="paragraph">We first went on Sharktank to get enough money to launch a factory to be able to quickly produce and export U-Airpods, while at the same time being concious of the enviorment. Thankfully, Lori decided to take a chance on us, and we have grown ever since!</p>

        <h1 id="title" >Sustainability</h1>
        <p id="paragraph">We try our best to make sure that our products are not only good, but are made in good consious. This is why we have devoted ourselves to do the least amount of impact on the enviorment. All of out U-Airpods are made from at least 75% recycled metals, meaning resuing old scraps, instead of continuing to dig into our planet. This way, we can provide goods for all of us, without taking away from our planet.</p>
